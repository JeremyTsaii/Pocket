# Tabulate

Tabulate is a Google Chrome Extension that is meant to help users who often leave many Chrome tabs open. Chrome tabs are notorious for taking up your CPU and memory, but often users do not want to lose the the pages that they were looking at. Tabulate lets you save these tab sessions and easily reopen them without them being active and hogging up your resources!

Check it out on the Chrome Web Store here.

### Using Tabulate

To open the Tabulate menu, click on the Tabulate icon in the upper right corner of Chrome. 

To save your current tab, click on the "Save Tab" button and choose a unique name for your session.

To save all the tabs in your current window, click on the "Save Session" button and choose a unique name for your session.

To delete a session from Tabulate, click on the red "X" at the right side of the session.

To open settings, click on the gear icon. The default settings are to close the tab(s) that you have just saved and to delete a session without confirmation. These settings can be changed by navigating to the settings page and checking the appropriate boxes.

Happy Tabulating!

### How Was This Developed?

Tabulate is written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It relies heavily on the Chrome Storage API to remember saved sessions and user preferences.
